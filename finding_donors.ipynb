    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1) Logistic Regression\n",
    "> a) One of the real world applications of logistic regression is used in early diagnosing certain medical conditions in individuals such as breast cancer, heart disease among others[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "> b) The strengths of the model is that it is a very simple yet powerful algorithm that does really well. The output is in terms of probabilites rather than outputting the class. Since it the target variable is probabilistic in nature, different metrics can be equipped to make decisions[2].  \n",
    "\n",
    "> c) One of the main weakness is when the feature space is very large[3], logistic regression doesn't fair that well and also logistic regression is a general linear model. It does not factor for the interactions between the attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> d) Logisitic regression is one of the basic models to implement when it comes to classification problems. As it has a nice setup, could tell the user if there is any linear relationship between the attributes and target variable. In our case, it could act as a very good intermittent step between the naive predictor and other models than could handle non linear relationships. And also logistic regression has smaller prediciton time as comapred to instance based learning models. Once the model is trained, and provided it yields a good score/accuracy, then the model is good to be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Random Forest \n",
    "> a) There are many applications of random forest since it is an ensemble method of many decision trees. One of the applications is where rotating machinery faults can be diagnosed[4].\n",
    "\n",
    "> b) One of the main strength of the random forest is that this algorithm has excellent execution time as very less time is required to train the model as opposed to SVM's, Neural Networks. Since it is an ensemble method of multiple decision trees, using only random attributes per decision tree and combining them reduces variablity in data and makes each decision tree less correlated with each other as opposed to bagging[5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "> c) One of the issues with random forest is that it is less interpretable, it is a good predictive tool but doesn't provide a lot of insight on the relations between target variable and its attributes as it involves combining multiple decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "> d) A decision tree can handle non linear features as well take into account variable interactions. A randomforest, being an ensemble of these decision trees inherits these features. In addition to them, combining multiple trees also reduce variablility. This model is applicable to CharityML as it can capture any variable interactions in the data. \n",
    "The result is obtained by averaging several trees, which significantly reduces risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Support Vector Machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "> a) A good application of SVM is in image classification[7]. \n",
    "\n",
    "> b) They can handle non linear feature space, non linear interactions between attributes. And also it does not depend on the enitre data set. Since only a few data points will have alphas as non zero, thus only a few support vectors. As opposed to logistic regression, a kernel could be used to transform the data to a higher dimensional space where the data is expected to be linearly separable[6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "> c) The execution time is relatively slow compared to other classification algorithms. Sometimes, it is quite difficult to find a kernel that can seperate the data even in higher dimensions[6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "> d) We can use the kernel trick in SVM as a result if there is any non linear relationships between the attributes and target variable, by using the kernel trick, we could transform the input data into a higher dimensional space where data would be likely more linearly separable. For e.g, using a RBF kernel we could practically transform data into an infinite dimensional space[6]. This model is applicable to charityML as it may capture any non linear relationship by transforming data into a higher dimensional space.  \n",

    "\n",
    "From the above shown graphs, we can see that all the 3 models, i.e., logistic regression, SVC, and Random forest models perform better than the naive predictor. While the naive predictor has an accuracy of 24% of predicting people earning more than 50K, we see that for the test set, using the above mentioned three models yields an accuracy of above 80%, so either of the 3 models outperforms the naive predictor. \n",
    "The choice of the model depends upon several factors. As we can see from the above graph that Fscores on test data for 100% training for the models are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Logistic Regression: 0.6831\n",
    "\n",
    "2) SVC: 0.6744\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Random Forest: 0.6682\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that roughly all of them yields a similar performance, however when we take prediction/training time for Random Forest and logistic regression is roughly 1-2 seconds, whereas for SVC, prediction time is almost 13 seconds and training time is 70 seconds. With these two parameters in mind; Fscore(test) and time taken, we can gravitate towards either logistic regression or Random forest. Furthermore, random forest has many parameters that can be optimised such as number of trees, the maximum number of attributes to be considered at each split, minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. On the other hand, logistic regression have fewer optimization parameters. Hence choosing random forest among the above models and thereby optimizing the model further would yeild a good result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is quite suitable for the data from charityML, as it takes less time than SVC and also has more optimization parameters, it has the best of both worlds, so to speak and would be a suitable candidate! \n",

    "Random forest is an ensemble of decision trees, i.e., random forest is obtained by combining multiple decision trees. \n",
    "In order to understand random forest, the basic concept of decision tree is essential. \n",
    "Decision tree is more like a rule based system. Given the training set with targets and attributes, the decision tree algorithm will come up with some set of rules. The same set rules can be used to perform the prediction on the test dataset. Suppose we would like to predict if an individual is likely to make a contribution to your charity then given the early records of different individuals, we could construct a decision tree and come with some rules. Now, the new individual's attributes are considered as inputs to your decision tree and based on the outcome of the decision tree, we could conclude as to how likely this individual would donate to your cause. \n",
    "Now decision trees by itself is slightly susceptible to data and is not robust; a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree[1]. To address this issue, one of the ways is to combine multiple decision trees. This model is referred to as random forest. \n",
    "<img src=\"RandForest.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, diagram[2] shows  three decision trees. Given a new input, tree 1 predicts 'red' outcome, tree 2 predicts 'green' outcome and tree 3 predicts 'red' outcome. So the resultant outcome is typically based on vote system for classification problems. since 2 out of 3 trees predict 'red' outcome, the final outcome is 'red'. This is how, a typical random forest works.  \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The final F-score and accuracy of training data on reduced feature space yields slightly lesser accuracy than training data on all the 13 features. A slight decrease of only 2% in accuracy and around 3% on F-Score sounds not a bad deal as training time would increase non linearly when considering more decision tress in random forests on all 13 features. So, personally, I'd prefer to train data on reduced feature space and would be willing to trade reduced features for training time."
